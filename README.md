## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JavaScript


### What I learned

At the end of this challenge, I got more knowledge about web layout and how to use flexbox. I also learned how to use custom properties to style elements. Besides, I practiced more how to manipulate DOM with JavaScript. Now, I feel more comfortable
to complete more challenges with what I learned.
